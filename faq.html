    <h1>FAQ</h1>
    <p><em>One of the videos isn't working:</em> Thank you for bringing this to my attention! You can email me at bearadventure4393@gmail.com and tell me which episode isn't playing.</p>
    <p><em>The episodes have ads:</em> They do indeed. I make no money from anything on this site, but unfortunately the video hosting site I use does indeed have ads. If you want to watch ad-free, may I recommend using Firefox? It's a great browser with a really good free adblocker. Until I find a better solution, I'm afraid we'll have to suffer through the ads. </p>
    <p><em>X episode/season isn't up:</em> This site is still very largely a work-in-progress. Hopefully they'll all be up soon, but if there is a particular episode you'd like to watch, feel free to send me an email and I'll see if I can't put that one up for ya!</p> 
    <p><em>Will you be adding the movie/season four/Play it Again, Dick:</em> Possibly! I don't know how much interest there is in these, but if people want them up, I can certainly do that. I'll probably finish the first three seasons first, though, as I don't really anticipate many people wanting these other things, but what do I know!</p>
    <p><em>My question isn't on this list:</em> As always, feel free to send me an email! I also have a <a href="https://listenupbuckaroos.tumblr.com">Tumblr</a> you can send asks to, if you'd rather.</p>
 <p>As always, stay safe on the internet and support creators whenever you can.</p>
