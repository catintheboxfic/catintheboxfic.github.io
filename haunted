<h2>
  Chapter 1: In Which Will Makes Eggs
</h2>
<p>Sydney had never had the best luck in life. Her fiance was dead, her mom had lied to her and was now collaborating with her old boss, and she kept losing her keys.</p>

<p>Finding a dead terrorist in her house was still pretty high on the list of bad things, though.</p>

<p>“Sark! How the hell did you get in here? I thought you were dead.” She trained her gun on the couch where he was sprawled out and staring at the ceiling.</p>

<p>“I believe I am.” He sat up, looking mildly surprised. “You can see me?”</p>

<p>“Unfortunately, yes. Why are you here? Did my mother send you?”</p>

<p>He frowned. “How long have you been able to see me?”</p>

<p>“What? I just saw you now. How long have you been here? What have you done?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t <i>done</i> anything,” he said crossly. “You killed me!”</p>

<p>
  <i>I do not have time for this.</i>
</p>

<p>“Sark,” she gritted through her teeth and stepped closer to the couch. “You are going to tell me why you’re in my house. And then you are going to leave, because as much as I would <i>love</i> to shoot you anyway, my friend is sleeping in the other room and I <i>really</i> don’t want to explain why I didn’t let <i>him</i> kill you.”</p>

<p>“Sydney,” he said slowly, like one might to a child. “You can call your friend out now if he so desperately wants to see me dead. You shot me. I am, apparently, dead.”</p>

<p>“Sark,” she said slowly, like one might to someone who has lost their mind. “I know you’re not dead. This is possibly the worst lie I’ve ever heard.”</p>

<p>He didn’t answer, just stood up and walked purposefully toward her. Before she could react, he slapped her fully across the face.</p>

<p>Or rather,  he tried to. His arm passed through her head, and she felt a horrible chill for a split second. Her hands flew to her face and she desperately tried to rationalize it.</p>

<p>
  <i>It has to be a trick. Or a dream. Yeah, a dream, that’s it. I just have to wake up.</i>
</p>

<p>She closed her eyes and imagined herself asleep in her bed. When she opened them, Sark was still standing in her living room staring at her.</p>

<p>“Are you convinced that I am not lying to you, now?”</p>

<p>“No. You can’t be <i>dead.</i> It doesn’t make sense.”</p>

<p>“I have to disagree.” He moved his jacket, and she could see a dark bloodstain on the shirt underneath, right where his heart was. “You’re quite an excellent shot.”</p>

<p>She remembered shooting him. She remembered him falling to the ground, but she hadn’t had time to check the body because Vaughn had been shot and Irina had called her name and they had chased her out and then the building had exploded. Sark had been presumed to be killed in the explosion, that is, if she hadn’t killed him already. </p>

<p><i>So him being dead does make sense. It’s the him being</i> here <i>that doesn’t.</i></p>

<p>“You’re really dead?” She studied him closer. He was wearing the outfit he had been wearing the last time she saw him, down to the clip-on tag that said Visitor on it. If this wasn’t a dream, it was a very good trick. Also a very weird trick.</p>

<p>He nodded solemnly. “I’m also a ghost, as you can see.” He waved his hand through the vase on the coffee table a couple of times to demonstrate.</p>

<p>Sydney suddenly felt rather shaky and sat down in the chair behind her. When she regained her voice, she asked, “So why are you here?”</p>

<p>Sark shrugged. “I’m haunting you, apparently.”</p>

<p>
  <i>Great.</i>
</p>

<p>“Why? Because I killed you? Can’t you get over it and leave the mortal plane or whatever?”</p>

<p>
  <i>This is absurd. I cannot be having a serious conversation about ghosts with Sark, of all people.</i>
</p>

<p>He shrugged again. “I don’t really know. I’m rather new to the whole thing, myself.”</p>

<p>Sydney buried her face in her hands and massaged her head.</p>

<p>
  <i>Oh god. I have to be crazy, right? I must be going insane and they’re going to fire me because I think I see ghosts and I’ll never get to have my revenge on Sloane and-</i>
</p>

<p>“Hey, Syd. Are you okay?” Will stood in the doorway, his hair still rumpled up from sleep. “I thought I heard you talking to someone.”</p>

<p>Sydney’s eyes went over to where Sark was standing, but Will hadn’t so much as glanced that direction.</p>

<p><i>Right. Because I’m crazy.</i> A hysterical laugh was stuck in her throat, so she shook her head. “I’m fine. I was just on the phone. I have to go back into the office today.”</p>

<p>Will nodded. “Hey, don’t overwork yourself, okay? I know that things have been weird lately, but…be careful. If you ever need help, or anything, I’ll always be here.”</p>

<p>Despite her roiling state of mind, Sydney smiled. “Thanks, Will. You’re the best.”</p>

<p>He smiled back at her. “Yeah, well don’t get yourself into <i>too</i> much trouble.” She laughed and Will walked into the kitchen. “Do you want any eggs?”</p>

<p>“Yeah, thanks.” Her brief good spirits were shattered once more when she saw Sark still standing in the middle of the room, pensively staring at Will.</p>

<p>
  <i>Whatever. She could ignore him, and maybe then he would leave. Good plan.</i>
</p>

<p>“Do you think I can still taste things?” Sark interrupted her thoughts. “I suppose it’s kind of like touching, but I’ve never tried touching anything with my mouth.”</p>

<p>“Let’s continue to not try that.” The mental image of a ghostly Sark trying to lick her food was not a pretty one.</p>

<p>“What?” Will asked from the kitchen.</p>

<p>
  <i>Right. Ignoring involves not talking.</i>
</p>

<p>“Sorry, I was just talking to myself.” </p>

<p>“That’s a little rude,” Sark remarked. “I wonder why he can’t see me.”</p>

<p>Sydney picked up one of Francie’s magazines from the coffee table and began to flip through it. </p>

<p>
  <i>Look, it’s a recipe for squash soup. You need vegetable broth.</i>
</p>

<p>“For that matter, how come I can stand and sit, but I can’t pick things up?”</p>

<p>
  <i>You need apples, too. That’s a little weird, apples in a soup.</i>
</p>

<p>“I wonder if I can walk through walls.”</p>

<p>
  <i>You put pepitas on top. I’ve never had pepitas before.</i>
</p>

<p>She steadfastly did <i>not</i> watch as Sark walked through her living room wall, but she shivered with cold as he came back into the room with a grin.</p>

<p>So did Will, she noticed.</p>

<p>Which meant that while <i>she</i> wasn’t crazy, she did have a crazy ghost to contend with.</p>

<p>“Did you see that? I can walk through walls!” Sark said happily.</p>

<p>Ignoring him still seemed like a pretty good option, though.</p>

<p>
  <i>You have to fry the onions and the garlic first. And there’s cayenne in it. What an odd soup.</i>
</p>

<p>“What else do you suppose I can do?” Sark wondered aloud. “What are ghosts supposed to be able to do?”</p>

<p>Sydney shut the magazine in frustration. Somehow the soup recipe wasn’t helping her ignore the dead guy in her house. “I’m going to go take a shower quick,” she told Will, then tried to gesture with her eyes at Sark to follow her. He raised an eyebrow but didn’t say anything as he followed her into the bathroom.</p>

<p>“This is much more interesting with the lights on,” he remarked as she turned the water on.</p>

<p>“What are you doing here?” she hissed.</p>

<p>“I thought you wanted me to follow you.”</p>

<p>“No, I mean, why are you <i>here.</i> In my house. Shouldn’t you haunt wherever you died?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think I can leave your house.”</p>

<p>“Explain.”</p>

<p>“The last thing I remember before all of this,” he gestured vaguely, “Was bleeding out on the stairs. Then all of a sudden I was on your lawn and you were walking into the house. I attempted to locate a payphone, but once I stepped onto the sidewalk, I appeared in your foyer. You didn’t notice me somehow, so I tried to open the door, but my hand couldn’t grab the knob, and I didn’t think to walk through it. I was still in denial about being dead at that point,” he admitted.</p>

<p>“Well, now you know you can walk through walls. What if you tried leaving again?”</p>

<p>Sark nodded and purposefully stepped through the wall. She held her breath and waited. </p>

<p>
  <i>I think I might have done it. He’s finally gone!</i>
</p>

<p>Just as she had begun to mentally cheer, Sark fell back into the room with a rush of cold air. “It didn’t work,” he said unnecessarily.</p>

<p>Sydney slumped onto the fluffy blue bath mat. “Maybe if you get over me killing you, you’ll vanish into hell or something.”</p>

<p>“Frankly, I’m a little offended that you don’t think I’d go to heaven.”</p>

<p>“You killed people, Sark.”</p>

<p>“So have you,” he pointed out.</p>

<p>“Only in self-defense. Now hurry up and forgive me or whatever.”</p>

<p>“And what if I don’t?” He crossed his arms over his chest. “Would you forgive <i>me</i> if I killed you?”</p>

<p>“If my other option was to be supernaturally bound to your house, then I would forgive you in a heartbeat.”</p>

<p>He rolled his eyes, but he cleared his throat and said, “Sydney Bristow, I forgive you for killing me.”</p>

<p>Nothing happened.</p>

<p>“Maybe <i>you</i> have to apologize for killing me. Perhaps you’re too bound up in your guilt, and I’m here to be a horrific reminder of what you’ve done” he suggested.</p>

<p>She glared at him. “You have the horrific part right, but trust me, I don’t have any guilt about this.”</p>

<p>He shrugged. “It can’t hurt to try.”</p>

<p>“It might,” she muttered under her breath, but she ground it out anyway. “Sark, I’m sorry I killed you.”</p>

<p>He lifted his eyes to the ceiling as if he expected it to open up and whisk him away, but the only thing that happened was the dull noise of Will banging a pan in the sink.</p>

<p>“It would appear we are stuck with each other.”</p>

<p>Sydney’s head sunk into her knees. <i>Great. I’m stuck with what appears to be an actual ghost who can’t leave my house or he gets teleported back, and who I can’t talk to without sounding like I’m insane. Not that I </i>wanted<i> to talk to him.</i></p>

<p>“If I may,” he said after a pause, “You might want to leave the bathroom before Mr. Tippin starts to worry.”</p>

<p>She glared at him, but he was right. She couldn’t hide in here forever, unfortunately. </p>

<p>
  <i>Alright, think about this. What do you need to do?</i>
</p>

<p>“First off, you need to leave the room so I can wet my hair. Second, you don’t talk to me around other people, period. In fact, the farther you stay away from me, the better, but I don’t believe that you’re going to actually leave me alone, are you?”</p>

<p>Sark shrugged, which she interpreted as him agreeing.</p>

<p>“Alright then, go.”</p>

<p>He walked through the door and Sydney let out a deep breath.</p>

<p>
  <i>I can do this. Somehow, I’ll get rid of him.</i>
</p>

<p>By the time she came into the kitchen, Will was leaving for work. “See you tonight?”</p>

<p>“Yeah. Thanks for the eggs.”</p>

<p>“Hey, no problem.” And then he was gone, leaving her with a plate of lukewarm scrambled eggs and a ghost who was staring at her plate longingly.</p>

<p>“I can smell them,” Sark said mournfully. “Can’t I try to taste them?”</p>

<p>“Absolutely not.”</p>

<p>“Could you at least pull a chair out for me?”</p>

<p>She rolled her eyes but kicked a chair out anyway. He sat down and used the opportunity to get even closer to her plate.</p>

<p>“It’s going to be a very long eternity if you don’t get over the food thing.”</p>

<p>“I don’t even like eggs,” he said as she took a bite, “But I might kill somebody to eat those.”</p>

<p>“You killed people normally. That kind of ruins the sentiment.”</p>

<p>“Can you leave the television on when you leave?” he asked, ignoring her comment.</p>

<p>“What are you, a dog with separation anxiety? I’m not wasting electricity on you.”</p>

<p>“Given that I cannot touch anything or leave the house, my entertainment options are somewhat limited.”</p>

<p>“Well, don’t worry, because your stay is going to be very short. I <i>am</i> going to get rid of you.”</p>

<p>He pursed his lips and nodded. “In the meantime, however, can you leave the television on?”</p>

<p>Sydney sighed and put her plate in the sink. <i>Probably better to have him watch tv than to have him snoop around. Which, who was she kidding, he was sure to do no matter what.</i> But she turned the tv on anyway before she left anyway, just to shut him up. </p>

<p>She did turn it to the food channel, though.</p>

<p>He shot her a look that said, ‘really?’, but all he said aloud was, “Goodbye, Agent Bristow. See you tonight.”</p>

<p><i>Not if I can help it,</i> she vowed internally. She started the car and backed out of the driveway.</p>

<p>No sooner had her car pulled out into the street then she felt an all too familiar chill, and a voice she had rather hoped to not hear for the rest of her life (or at least a few hours) said, “It seems that I’m attached to you, not your house.”</p>

<p>Sydney buried her head in her hands.</p>

<p>
  <i>Great. Just great.</i>
