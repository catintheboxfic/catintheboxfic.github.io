  <b>1 Day-1961</b>
</p>
<p>The sand crunched softly beneath her feet, and she had to bite her lip to keep from whimpering. Most of the bodies had been covered by last night’s wild sandstorm, but she could still see the outlines of hands, hair sticking out of the ground like it was grass, scraps of brightly coloured fabric. The wind had died down and now the air was so still she couldn’t stand it. </p>

<p>She slowly made her way through the camp, looking inside and underneath all the buildings. She couldn’t make herself actually step into any of the bunks, and had to be content with peering in through the windows. Everywhere she looked was horribly, achingly empty, except under the thin layer of sand that she refused to so much as glance at again.</p>
<p>How could this be a safe place for her? It was so lonely and awful and there was so much death here. </p>


  <p><em> Because of you, </em> her mind whispered. <em> They all died because of you. </em></p>
<p>“No,” she said quietly, trying to banish the thought, and shuddered at how <em> loud </em>it sounded. “Banana said I’ll be safe here. She’ll come back and get me.”</p>

<p>Then it wouldn’t be lonely, and Angela would explain to her how everything could be right again, just like her dream promised. Angela’s dreams always came true. She just had to wait.</p>

<p>She went to sit on the steps of the mess hall when she saw a hand sticking up from the sand, reaching desperately for something, and she recognized the pretty gold wedding band on the finger. She fell to the ground sobbing as the wind picked up again, and soon it was too loud to hear her crying anyway. </p>

<p>

</p>

<p>She still could not make herself enter the bunks, so she lived in the bunker, where it was cool and cans of food lined the shelves. Sometimes her supplies would dip low and she would sneak into town and steal some more. She didn’t like to leave Coyote Sands too long, in case Angela came back while she was away. </p>

<p>She stole a book off a table in someone’s yard, one day, because she was bored and wanted to read, but couldn't make herself find any of her old books. It was called <em> My Side of the Mountain, </em>and she fell in love with Sam, who was living by himself, too. </p>

<p>When she was in town she looked through the windows of the diner, the stores, anywhere that Angela could be. She had to steal new clothing–she never had much to begin with and now what she had she was outgrowing–but never socks. Angela was going to bring her new socks, and it would be awkward if she already had them.</p>
<p>She heard the people gossip about the huge sandstorm sometimes, about the horrible tragedy at Coyote Sands. Sometimes people went out there to explore, teenagers mostly, daring their friends to go look in windows or touch the sign. Whenever they came, though, the wind would always pick up and dark clouds would rumble overhead, and they’d always decide to come back some other day.</p>

<p>She finished the book and felt betrayed. When Sam’s father comes, he doesn’t take Sam away with him. Sam <em> wants </em> to stay by himself, all alone in the forest. She put the book back on the table where she found it, and took the book that was there in its stead. It was called <em> The Swiss Family Robinson, </em>and she hoped that they were more sensible people.</p>

<p>One day a dog follows her back from town. She names it Rick, after the boy that Angela was hoping would ask her to prom. It would make her laugh when she found out, she thought.</p>

<p>Rick was small and brown and his fur shed all over her hands when she petted him. She fed him pieces of bread and corn and tried to teach him how to fetch sticks. That would impress Angela when she came back, if Rick was perfectly trained just like Sam’s Frightful.</p>

<p>Rick did not pick up the stick, but instead started digging in the sand until she could see the sun glint off of something white. She felt sick to her stomach and called Rick away. The next morning, there was a small brown dog tied up outside the grocery store, and nobody came to get him until finally the bewildered grocer took it home.</p>
<p>She heard people talk about Christmas, heard the children complain that there wasn’t going to be any snow like there always was in <em> proper </em>Christmases, the type they had in movies. She remembered there being snow in New York and playing outside with Angela. Angela was always bundled up in a million coats and still complained of the cold, and she would laugh and take her scarf off and give it to Angela because she liked to feel a chill on her neck. </p>

<p>That year, miraculously, it snowed on Christmas. It had all melted by the next day, of course, leaving nothing but some puddles as a reminder that it had ever existed. When she went into town, the people were abuzz with talk of the unbelievable event.</p>

<p>It snowed on Christmas in Coyote Sands every year after. </p>

</p>

<p>There was a man named Robert who lived in a trailer about a two hour walk away from Coyote Sands. He gave her molasses cookies and jerky that made her throat burn, and she would give him cans of corn and beans and pieces of wood for him to carve. While he whittled the wood away into recognizable shapes, he’d tell her the same stories over and over. His wife, his time as a medic in the army, his beautiful cat who would sit in the window of his apartment and hiss at birds. Sometimes he’d stop in the middle of a story and stare at the horizon, and then she would quietly take the rest of the jerky and one of his knives and leave, because when he did that he wouldn’t come back for hours.</p>

<p>He gave her a carving of a coyote, its ears flat against its head and its head tilted back in a permanent howl. She thanked him and said she’d show it to her sister. It would be funny, she said, because she lived at Coyote Sands. He asked if her sister lived there too, and if she needed more jerky to bring to her.</p>

<p>“Not yet,” she told him, running her fingers over the rough wood. “She doesn’t live there yet.” </p>

<p>One day she went down to the trailer and he was not there. Instead, there was a couple and their young girl, and they watched her politely, warily, curiously. She did not say anything to them, and instead turned around and started the long walk back to the bunker. Robert would not be back, she knew.</p>

<p>As she walked through the desert, the sun heated the metal of the knives she was going to return, burning her hands.</p>
<p>

</p>

<p>Daniel came to visit her one day, as she sat on the ground aimlessly tearing pieces of dry grass apart in her hands. It wasn’t the first time one of them came, but it was the first time he had, though he didn’t say anything much different than the others at first.</p>

<p>“She’s not coming back for you, you know,” he said, almost apologetically, and tugged the sleeves of his red jacket lower. “She’s having a wonderful time with us. She’s much too busy to come back.” </p>

<p>She had always rather liked Daniel. Once, she had fallen off the swings and scraped her arm up dreadfully, and though she had <em> not </em> cried–she was much too old for <em> that </em>–it had stung and hurt like anything. Daniel had noticed and come over and done impressions of all sorts of people: Dr. Suresh; Priscilla the cook, who always looked at you with only one eye or the other but never both at once; Mr. Monroe, the guard who told them wild stories about dragons and far-off wars. He delivered it all in his soft, funny accent, and by the time he walked away the sting had completely faded from her arm, and when she looked, the scrape was gone.</p>

<p>“She is, too,” she replied with great dignity. “She promised.”</p>

<p>Daniel shook his head. “Why don’t you come with me? We can go look for her.”</p>
<p>That made her pause. The others who came to talk to her never offered <em> that. </em>They only told her that Angela wasn’t coming back for her, that she would be alone forever. Sometimes, her poor friend Carol would come to visit, with her dark curls and big sad eyes, and ask why she made them all die. She never stayed around to play.</p>

<p>“I can’t. Her dream said I’d be safe here.”</p>
<p>“Angela’s dreams always come true, don’t they,” he mused. “I guess you’re right. Are you sure you won’t come?”</p>


<p>She nodded. “I’m sure.”</p>
<p>Daniel frowned. “I’m afraid we won’t ever see each other again, then.”</p>


<p>“No,” she agreed. “Not until Banana comes to get me.”</p>
<p>He shook his head. “I don’t think even then. I’ll miss you, Alice.”</p>

<p>He put a hand on her knee and stood up to go, and a breeze rustled through her hair and blew the grass from her hands. When she looked, Daniel was gone. </p>

<p>She never got another visitor after that.</p>
<p>
  <b>40 Years-2001</b>
</p>
<p>She had started collecting the newspapers in the seventies. At first she had been getting them for Robert, then, once he left, she started keeping them for herself and Angela. </p>

<p>They were all kept in huge stacks, organised by date, and she wrote little notes in the margins, that way when Angela came she could tell her all about what she had missed.</p>
<p>She kept all the editions published on Angela’s birthday, and circled the comics that were particularly funny. She made notes by the articles that talked about snow on Christmas, explaining how <em> she </em> was the one who had made that happen. She circled the names of movies she wanted to see in the theatre with Angela, and gave the <em> real </em>story of what happened to the Walker’s hens. </p>

<p>She didn’t get any visitors anymore, but she still talked to them. She explained to Carol the proper way to get rid of snakes, argued with Bobby about whether Mr. Monroe had <em> actually </em>fought in the Civil War, and pleaded with Daniel to come talk to her again. She never talked to Angela though, because she knew she was coming back for real. </p>

<p>Sometimes men had come and tried to investigate the ruins of the camp, to take files, even on one memorable occasion to rebuild it. They always found the weather too inhospitable to do anything, because she knew they would try and take her away from where Angela said she was safe.</p>

<p>It didn’t matter how the coyote howls had chilled her, how hungry she could get, the sick feeling that crept up whenever she saw a sand dune shaped a particular way or how lonely she felt, Coyote Sands was where she was safe because Angela’s dream had said this. </p>

<p>And Angela’s dreams were never wrong.</p>

<p>
  <b>48 Years-2009</b>
</p>

<p>The strange woman collapsed outside her bunker, except she wasn’t particularly strange. She felt as if the woman’s name were on the tip of her tongue, that if she could just reach back far enough she would know it. She dragged her inside and set her on the bed, then went to go see what the other strangers were doing.</p>

<p>She had <em> wished so hard </em> that one of them would be Angela, but the only one who looked young enough was the girl, and while <em> she </em>had Angela’s stubbornness in her eyes, she was not Angela. She was reminded of Angela again when she saw one of the men, his face firmly unreadable and calculating in the way that her sister’s were when she didn’t want you to know something, and again with another one of them, his smile genuine and his eyes conflicted the way she remembered her sister’s face the night she left. But still, none of them were Angela.</p>

<p>They were <em> all </em> stubborn, though, as it turned out, because despite her efforts the storm did not dissuade them. Some of them were calling out for their mother, who she supposed was the woman in her bunker. She went back to return the woman to them so they could finally <em> leave </em>her, but when she got back the woman had already woken up. And when she saw the woman’s eyes, hope came flooding back.</p>

<p>“Alice?” the woman whispered. “Alice?”</p>
<p>She had waited so long for this, and now that it was finally happening she couldn’t even bear to look.</p>

<p>“Alice, please,” the woman pleaded. “Look at me, Alice.”</p>

<p>Vaguely she wondered why this woman insisted on saying her name so often, but when she finally turned around all thoughts flew out of her head. </p>

<p>“Banana?” She stepped forward tentatively, and then Angela was <em> there, </em>holding her, and she couldn’t stop herself from crying. “I’ve waited for you, like you said. Where it was safe,” she managed between sobs.</p>
<p>It almost sounded like Angela laughed, but when she looked her face was sad. “Oh, Alice, I’m so sorry. I am so, so sorry.”</p>

<p>“You don’t need to be.” Her words tripped out of her before she even fully knew what she was saying. “I stayed because you said I would be safe here, and I was, see?”</p>
<p>She didn’t mention always watching the sky to avoid looking at the ground, the nightmares, the ghosts that haunted her and told her lies. </p>

<p>She wanted to show Angela the newspapers, tell her about Rick and Robert’s cat, about making the town love her even though they didn’t know she existed. She wanted to hear about Angela’s adventures, about where she had been and what dreams she had had. She wanted to go home.</p>

<p>Angela shook her head. “I lied that night, Alice. I was just trying to keep you safe. I never did have that dream.”</p>

<p>She couldn’t breathe. That couldn’t possibly be true, she had lived her entire <em> life </em>based around this dream, this promise. </p>
<p>“No, no, your dreams always come true.” Angela's eyes filled with pity, and she wished that she would just stop <em> looking at her like that </em>. </p>

<p>“They do. But I lied, Alice. I’m so sorry.”</p>
<p>She could feel the static in the air, hear the wind that had finally calmed start up again. “Get out,” she managed to growl. “<em> Get out.” </em></p>

<p>But Angela wouldn’t, and then the other strangers were there. <em> Her family, </em> Angela had shouted over the roaring wind. Lightning streaked across the bunker, hitting people who were supposed to care for her, to tell the truth to her. </p>

<p>One of the strangers yelled for her to calm down, his manner so similar to Dr. Suresh’s in a way that Daniel could never hope to imitate, and it struck her that she was going to ruin everything. Again.</p>

<p>She ran to the top of the stairs and looked back on the scene below her. Her family, the doctor, her sister telling her to stay. It was all so familiar, but she knew now that it didn’t matter, because this had never been the place that would keep her safe anyway. </p>

<p>There was no point in causing another tragedy at Coyote Sands.</p>

<p>As she walked away into the swirling sand, she realised that that meant there had never been any point to the first.</p>

<p> </p><hr />
<p>She waited at the bus stop in the early morning hours, and for the first time in over twenty years, Daniel joined her.</p>

<p>“Where will you go?” he asked.</p>

<p>“It doesn’t matter. I can go anywhere.”</p>
<p>He nodded. “I offered to help you find her, once,” he said suddenly. “I told you she lied.”</p>

<p>“You told me she lied about her promise,” she pointed out. “Not the dream.”</p>
<p>“Does it matter which part she lied about?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” she said, suddenly frustrated. “I don’t want to talk about her anymore.”</p>
<p>“Alright,” he agreed, and they waited in silence.</p>
  <p>“You said I’d never see you again,” she said after a minute.</p>
<p>He looked at her curiously and a bit sadly. “You know none of us were ever really there, right? You know we’d all be old now, if we weren’t dead?”</p>

<p>She avoided his gaze. “Yeah.”</p>
<p>“Oh, Alice.” He smiled at her. “You’re going to be fine.”</p>
<p>“Will I?” she said, desperation creeping into her voice. “I lived so long waiting for one thing, thinking that things weren’t my fault because I was <em> supposed </em>to be there, and now I have no idea what to do.”</p>
<p>“I feel like we’re talking about Angela again.” He noticed her glare and added, “Look, you lived for almost fifty years by yourself, and you got along just fine.”</p>
<p>“Because she <em> told </em>me I was supposed to be there.”</p>

<p>“Right,” he agreed readily, “but Angela wasn’t there. Sure, you stayed there, but you didn’t have to make it snow for those kids, or write in those newspapers. Angela never told you to do any of <em> that. </em>”</p>
<p>“But I <em> did </em>it for her. I wanted to make her proud of me, tell her stories.”</p>
<p>“Then do things for yourself, now.” He shrugged. “You never needed her, anyway.”</p>
<p>She wasn’t quite sure he was right and opened her mouth to tell him that, when the bus pulled up with a screech.</p>
<p>“This is where we part ways, I believe.” He stood up and shook her hand. “I don’t think we’ll be seeing each other again.”</p>
<p>“That’s what you said last time,” she pointed out.</p>
<p>“This time, though, I don’t think you’ll need to see me again. You’re going to do just fine, Alice.”</p>
<p>She gave him a worried smile and boarded the bus. When she turned to look back through the glass doors, he was gone again.</p>
<p>Oh well. <em> Maybe he was right, </em> she thought as she found a seat. <em> Maybe I don’t need to be here with them anymore. </em></p>
<p>The bus groaned as it pulled away from the curb, and the town got smaller as they went farther and farther away from it.</p>
<p><em> Maybe, </em> her mind suggested, <em> maybe you never did. </em></p>
<p>And as Coyote Springs fully disappeared from her sight, for the first time in many, many years, she felt safe.</p>
